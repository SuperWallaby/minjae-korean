          In the age of AI, I’ve been asking myself this question
          <br />
          <strong>What kind of Korean teacher should I become?</strong>{" "}
          <br></br>
          <strong>나는 어떤 한국어 선생님이 되어야 할까?</strong>

          These days, AI can do so many things.
          <br />
          So I think my role as a Korean teacher will change.

          I want to become part of your daily routine.

          You can study alone. But there’s a reason people still go to classes.
          <Gap />
          When you meet a teacher and learn together, you feel something
          different —
          <br />
          a sense of connection, empathy, and confidence that you’re on the
          right path.
          <Gap />
          Those are things that are hard to feel when you study alone. <br></br>

          Maybe one day, AI will express emotions even better than humans.
          <Gap />
          But they doesn’t truly feel those emotions.
          <br />
          It only knows how to simulate them.
          <Gap />
          As a human, I want to understand you, relate to you, laugh with, and
          growth together.

          My lessons will focus on conversation.

          Because nothing helps you improve speaking more than actually speaking
          with another person.
          <Gap />
          But to have meaningful conversations, we need something to talk about.

          We will talk about the topics together.

          We can share thoughts, opinions, and ideas.
